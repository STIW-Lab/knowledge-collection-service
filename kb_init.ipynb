      "     \"selftext\": \"My husband is a member of a club that meets about twice monthly, and has been going to this club for about 6 years. I usually don't go because they're all talking about eye crossingly booring stuff (electronics and stuff), but every once in a while I go if they're doing something halfway interesting, just enough so that I know most of them at least a little bit. \\n\\nLast week was the monthly breakfast social at a diner that makes amazing breakfast stuff. They hadn't seen me since last summer, and some hadn't seen me since the summer before (when I was about 300lbs). My conversation with several guys I remember was oddly stilted and uncomfortable, and I couldn't figure out why. \\n\\nYesterday I found out exactly why. They had another event this weekend, and two of them cornered my husband and wanted to know WTF happened to his wife/marriage, and when did he get a new girlfriend? At first my husband thought they were teasing, then he realized they actually believed the woman with him at the breakfast a week ago was not the same person as his wife. He had to show several of my progress pictures (on his cell phone) to get them to believe it was still me!\\n\\nWhen I stopped by to snag my husband back from them, they approached me and apologized. But it was hilarious. It's not the first time someone who hadn't seen me in a while didn't recognize me, but it was the first time it resulted in such a misunderstanding.\\n\\nEdit: link to photos for those who requested them - https://i.redd.it/3zrn55mrq8j01.jpg\",\n",

      "     \"title\": \"I'm an RN taking care of COVID-19 patients. An experience I had with one of them has completely reshaped how my brain thinks about food and life.\",\n",
      "     \"selftext\": \"This is a throwaway account to protect my identity, my patients, and my employer. I'm willing to provide proof if mods request it.\\n\\nI work as an RN in a rather densely populated suburban hospital in the Northeast US. A couple weeks ago, we started getting COVID-19 cases in my unit. All of these patients we considered \\\"rule out\\\", as in we literally didn't have the tests to swab them with so we were forced to assume they had the disease if they were showing symptoms.  So far, the large majority of these patients were negative and sent home (Great News!).  However, that doesn't mean we haven't had our share of positives.  These patients can seem okay, but a smaller number of them can slowly deteriorate.  I had experience with one of them.  He was a rather healthy and active 40-ish year old male, slightly overweight, slightly hypertensive (high blood pressure).  He was complaining of a little bit of sharp pain in his chest when breathing in.  Otherwise, he was stable, we were just giving him a little oxygen.  My next night with him, he was on a little more oxygen because his oxygen saturation started dropping, but otherwise stable.  The next night, he couldn't breathe if he talked for more than a few sentences at a time (very bad sign), but again, still stable otherwise.  In the back of my head I knew he going to deteriorate further and probably would need to be intubated and attached to a ventilator eventually.  I gave him a breathing treatments with little effect, I increased his oxygen with little effect, but again, he was still stable.  I informed the doctors of this so they were aware, but there was really nothing further we could do for him at that point as I had given him every appropriate medication and intervention.  Close to the end of my shift his call light went off and I can hear him in the room absolutely gasping for air.  Without even going in the room I called for a rapid response (the emergency team in the hospital).  Mind you, it takes a solid 2 minutes just to get inside these rooms with all the PPE (e.g. gloves, gown, N95 mask, and face shield) we're required to wear.  By the time I got in, his lips were blue, he's gasping for air, and absolutely begging to breathe normally.  He was immediately intubated by the hospitalist and sent to the ICU.  He's currently sedated, intubated, on a ventilator, and on a rotoprone bed (a bed that rotates you like a rotisserie chicken to move accumulated fluid in your lungs).  I currently have no idea if he'll make it through this.\\n\\nI understand this was only my first patient for this to happen to.  There are going to be tens/hundreds more most likely.  But, it's already completely changed me.  I'm a big guy, I've always been overweight.  I'm 6'2\\\", 285lbs and have the same body type and a couple of the same co-morbidities as that patient.  Hearing that COVID-19 affects people with hypertension and obesity harder than other people scares the absolute crap out of me after seeing it first hand. We're being forced to reuse PPE (only the N95 masks at this point), so I know I'm most likely going to be exposed to this disease at some point.  I used to binge eat after work to calm the stress.  Now, the thought of eating an entire frozen pizza or an entire bag of chips absolutely disgusts me to my core.  I know that I'm at increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and other terrible diseases but COVID is a slowly progressing, agonizing disease.  It has completely scared me straight.  I understand it's sad that it's taken this crisis for me to care about myself but it's forced me to reevaluate what is important in life.  I guess as an RN, I've always thought about others before myself, but this has made me realize I WANT TO LIVE.  I want to be healthy.  If I get sick, I don't want it to be because I didn't care for myself.  I want it to be because it was my time, and knowing that I did everything I could do for myself.\\n\\nI've been counting my calories.  I've been eating way more salads, grilled chicken, rice, vegetables and I feel great.  I've lost 7 lbs in the past week.  With the quarantine situation, I've been taking more walks outside in the fresh air (which is great for my mental health).  I know the weight loss will slow over time, but I'm in this for the long haul.\\n\\nAlso, younger people, YOU ARE NOT IMMUNE.  Take this disease deadly serious, because it is deadly.  Don't play the COVID ventilator lottery because you want to go drinking or have a night out.  Your night out is not worth tying up a ventilator for 2-3 weeks to keep you alive instead of someone else.\\n\\nTL;DR: Simply be happy you are able breathe because you never know when that will be taken from you.\\n\\nedit:  This is so cliche as a redditor since the great digg-pocalypse of 2010, but I never expected for this post to blow up so much.  I need to be responsible with the platform I guess I have right now. I realize people are scared and hungry for any information at all about what is going on.  I absolutely encourage you to read all the official government information on this virus.  Read all the information of official sites like the FDA, NIH, and CDC.  Pay attention to what your local governments are doing and recommending and PLEASE follow what they are telling you to do.  Stay safe, I need to sleep.\",\n",

      "     \"title\": \"NSV: Today my doctor told me that he was proud of me. It's the first time I can remember anyone ever saying that to me.\",\n",
      "     \"selftext\": \"Hello everyone. This is my first post here. I've been commenting a little but never posted before.\\n\\nI started seeing my doctor in February when I was 530 pounds I had already lost 75 pounds at this point but I'm not sure if he really believed me when I told him. He asked me what my health goals were and I told him \\\"I want to lose 100 pounds before I turn 29 in October. He told me \\\"well, that's a lot of weight\\\" and never said much else about it.\\n\\nToday I went in and got weighed at 398 pounds. I beat my goal by 32 pounds and 2 months. When he looked at my chart he said \\\"wow, you did it! I'm really proud of you, keep it up!\\\"\\n\\nI honestly teared up as soon as he walked out of the room, because this was the first time I can remember of anyone ever telling me they were proud of me. \\n\\nIt's been a struggle and I'm still fighting the 600 pound person inside of me, but it's worth it and I feel for the first time in my life that I have some control. Every day, he gets weaker, and the new me gets stronger.\\n\\nHow I've lost the 200+ pounds in less than a year, about 0.66 pounds a day:\\n\\n\\nI started at just counting calories and limiting myself to under 3800 calories per day. I lost a pound a day for a month. I weighed myself every day and if the scale stopped moving, I lowered my calories a bit until they did, and the scale would start moving again. I was down to 3000 calories per day after a month and I was still losing a pound a day. Then I went to about 2500, and eventually now I'm at about 1800-2200 per day.\\n\\nI started intermittent fasting about a month and a half ago. I eat during an 6 to 8 hour window and fast the rest of the day. This has gotten me out of my last plateau and I really like how it makes me feel during the day.\\n\\nI eat a huge salad every single day, and I mean huge. I use an 8 quart mixing bowl for my salad bowl. I usually eat 2 or 3 heads of lettuce a day, or spinach. Greens are my friend. I am definitely a volume eater. I also eat a ton of beans. Legumes are my main protein source. The more beans I eat, the more weight I seem to lose.\\n\\nI eat lots of fruits. Pretty much any and all kinds of fruits. I don't limit myself on any fruits or vegetables, except avocados. I keep those to 1 per day, max.\\n\\nI have a smoothie every evening, usually with about a quarter pound of kale, some ice,  a banana, and some almond milk and a table spoon of flax seeds and two packets of stevia. Its under 300 calories and it makes about 2 quarts. I think it's delicious too. It keeps me full all night and I'm not really hungry until about 4 to 5 hours after waking up the next morning.\\n\\nBut all of that is just minutea.\\n\\n The real way I lost this weight was by being honest with myself and finding a reason, a \\\"why\\\" to live.  Neitzche said \\\"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how\\\" and this has rung true for me. I've known how to lose weight for years. You consume less calories than you expend. It's basic physics. But it wasn't until I had a good enough why to live that I actually changed my life. \\n\\nIt was almost a year ago. I was sitting in an abandoned shed, homeless, nothing to live for, no one that loved me, no friends, nothing. I decided that I was going to kill myself. I was a burden on society and I was worthless.  When I decided to kill myself, something changed. I though \\\"well, if I'm already dead, maybe I should just try as hard as I can to change this if I'm just going to die anyways\\\". When I think back to that day now, my thought process doesn't make that much sense to me now, but I was in a bad place.\\n\\nBut in a way, I did die that night. The victim in me died. The person that made excuses died. The person that never gave a shit about anything, and just blamed his troubles on everything around him died. I had to completely transform who I was, what my self talk was, the way I carried myself, everything.  All of this took time and I didn't change overnight, but what I did do was make that decision to change.\\n\\nThe absolute biggest thing was that mindset change. I journal a lot about my weight loss and my life. Writing helps me think, and it lets me see in writing some times the faulty logic that I'm running through my head, but I'd never second guess it if I didn't see it written out in front of me. This is absolutely critical for me. When I started my weight loss journey, I wrote about how I got to this weight, and why I weigh 600 pounds, and then I wrote about where I want to be in 5 years.\\n\\n If you want to transform your life, you need a good enough \\\"why\\\". A reason that keeps you going in the hardest times when you're tapped out of motivation and will power. You need to have something to run towards, and something to run away from. \\n\\nFor me, I want a family. I want to be a dad. What is what I'm running towards. I want to have someone that loves me as much as I love them. I have daydreams of playing with my kids, and teaching them things my father never taught me.\\n\\n And what I'm running from is being a bed ridden 30 something, dying alone in an apartment with no one to even check on me until they smell the death in the hallways. And then no one left to mourn me. No funeral, nothing. Just a dead fat guy that probably took a crane and a few dozen firefighters to remove the body.\\n\\nEvery time I feel weak, or depressed, or unmotivated or feel like quitting, I revisit my journal and it reminds me why I'm fighting this war on my own obesity. And it doesn't matter if i lose a few battles as long as i get back up and keep fighting. This has been the most powerful tool for me and really is the only reason I'm still going today. I highly recommend you start journaling I'd you're not already.\\n\\n\\nAnyways.. I just wanted to share with you guys.\\n\\nThanks for listening to me ramble!\\n\\n\\nEdit: Here is a progress photo. Not sure if this might be considered NSFW, but it shows my gut when I was really fat.  [Progress pic](https://imgur.com/Mr34eyV \\\"I'm in awe of the size of this lad, absolute unit\\\")\\n\\n\\nI still have a long way to go, but I know I'll get there.\\n\\nEdit2: Wow you guys are incredible! I didn't expect this thread to blow up so much! I'm already up way too late reading all of your comments! I have to get up at 5 AM! I promise to read every one of your comments tomorrow! Thank you guys so much.\\n\\n**Edit 3: I'm still reading all of your comments! Thank you guys so much for all of the kind words.  A lot of people have asked me if I will post updates and keep writing. I have been posting life updates for about 6 months in my subreddit at r/lifestartsnow - if you guys want to keep up to date with me I post updates about once a month or so over there!  Thank you guys so much for all the love! I'm blown away by all the support!**\\n\\n\\nEdit: I got married!\",\n",

It culminated in December when I very nearly wasn't allowed to board a flight to Texas because the agent at the security checkpoint couldn't verify the ID was mine.\\n\\nSo I finally bit the bullet last week and went to the DMV to take a new photo. In DC, you can't simply request a new photo to be taken if you don't like yours, so on the application the employee had to make a note about why I was getting a new photo while my license is still current. And on the form she wrote \\\"New ID required. Reason: weight loss.\\\"\\n\\nThe new ID arrived in the mail today. It's a little thing, but holding the two photos side by side was a good reminder of how far I've come on this journey.

      "     \"selftext\": \"Hello! My name is Erika, I'm 26 years old, and I have lost 252 pounds. I'm writing this on the last night of my family's annual vacation to Lava Hot Springs, Idaho. This is our 16th year and I can finally say that I have truly and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this vacation. Lava Hot Springs is a tiny, wonderful tourist town with a huge swimming pool, natural hot springs, a fun river for tubing, and a bunch of cute shops. It's super small - everything is in walking distance! We come up every year and rent out a house for a week and have tons of fun just vegging out. \\n\\nTwo years ago, July of 2018, was the most miserable year yet. I was at my heaviest of 425 pounds. I was wearing a 6X one piece swimsuit that was so tight that I had to have my mother help me squeeze into it every time I wanted to put it on. Going to the pool and the hot springs was absolutely miserable - it was embarrassing and I was uncomfortable and hot. The walk from the car to the pool was so hard. There's a ramp you have to walk down to get to the hot springs - walking up that ramp was too hard. I couldn't walk down tiny Main Street without having to stop every few feet for a break. The house we rent is at the top of a hill and I absolutely refused to walk up and down it. The town is tiny but I made us drive everywhere because I could not handle the walking. I opted out of several family activities (such as tubing down the river) because I just couldn't do it. I couldn't fit into the chairs out on the deck - the sides of the chairs squeezed into my thighs and left marks. I needed help getting out of them most of the time. I was hot and sweaty and I wanted to have fun and relax but I just couldn't. This wonderful vacation that I was supposed to be enjoying made me hate myself and my life even more.\\n\\nThis year, August of 2020, I weigh 173 pounds. This vacation is everything I ever wanted it to be and more. We've had to make adjustments due to the current world situation (we did not go to the pool, spent a lot of time in our rented house, and wore masks and social distanced when going out) but I have had the time of my life. I am now in a size 10/medium swimsuit and I don't need any help getting into it. We have walked EVERYWHERE, largely at my insistence. I've taken walks every day, up and down some pretty steep hills that I never would have been able to manage before. The chairs out on the deck are perfectly comfortable and I need no help getting in and out. It's been in the upper 90s all week but I haven't been the slightest bit uncomfortable. I've had no worries about missing out, no worries about over exerting myself, no worries about people seeing me and laughing at me. I've just been... happy. Content. Relaxed. And that is not something I'm used to.\\n\\nI feel free. I think that's the best way to describe it; I feel free. I'm coming up on my two year anniversary of my gastric bypass surgery and I'm grateful every day that I made the decision to take my life back. I've made some serious life changes. I follow a very healthy diet - 1600 calories, 100g of protein, 100-125g of carbs, less than 60g of fat, less than 30g of sugar, lots of water, yoga every day, 10,000 steps five days a week. Surgery has been a tool but it's me who has made the changes and taken my life back.\\n\\nWe head back tomorrow and I'm so excited to come back next year, hopefully at my goal weight of 150 pounds. I am grateful and happy and feel so lucky to be living the life I'm living now!\\n\\nJust for fun - [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/X1OLXzE) and [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/2JOnOyT) are some before and after pictures I recreated this year. \\n\\nThank you for reading! I am more than happy and willing to answer any and all questions!\",\n",

Once a week, on weigh-in day (which is typically Monday or Tuesday) I enter data from my apps to track trends including: Starting weight, current weight, amount of weight lost or gained for the week, daily calorie average for the week, weekly calorie total, weekly total of calories burned via exercise, starting BMI, current BMI, current weight BMR, and weekly calorie deficit.\\n \\nWith formulas in place it is a snap to enter data and see trends so that I can make adjustments to CICO (calorie in and calories out), to ensure I am on the right path. \\n\\nSince I do a lot of VR based cardio on the Oculus Rift, I use data from the VR institute of Health to calculate calorie burn when playing certain exercise-based games such as Beat Saber, Thrill of the Fight, Holopoint, Audio Shield, Gorn, Fruit Ninja VR, Space Pirate Trainer, etc. \\n\\nMy current favorite Oculus game for cardio is Sound Boxing, I typically do 60-90-minute straight sessions on Sound Boxing a few days a week. \\n\\nLast, I use a website called WebMD which has calculators to determine calorie burn for other activities, such as doing squats, swimming, playing an instrument while standing etc. \\n\\nWith all of this data available to me, I was able to start making smarter choices every week and it shows in my overall trends. \\n\\nFinal bits of advice are learning what an actual serving size is by utilizing a digital scale to record the food you eat down to the gram so that you have accurate data on CICO, you will be shocked at how small a serving size really is once you start weighing food out.\\n \\nAnother thing you can do is learn to read labels. Look for things like serving size, calories per serving, servings per container. If you have certain nutrition goals in mind read the labels for that info, I personally like to limit salt intake as it makes my weight spike due to water retention and I previously had high blood pressure (which is now cured via weight loss). \\n\\nI do all of my own meal prep and will typically go to a restaurant supply store and buy disposable microwave food trays that have three sections (protein, veggie, and veggie is what I put into them), and will normally make two meals for myself and my girl at a time so that we can just come home and reheat the trays while I prepare our evening salads.  \\n\\nA typical dinner for me is:\\n150 grams of spring mix salad (30 calories), with Greek yogurt blue cheese dressing (60 calories), a diced plum tomato (11 calories), and 3 oz. of radish coins (12 calories), seasoned with Nu-Salt, and crushed red pepper flakes.\\n\\n8 oz of Shady brook farms boneless turkey breast cutlets baked in a 375-degree oven for 12-15 minutes (220 calories and 50 grams of protein)\\n\\n2 cups of steamed broccoli florets (40 calories). \\n1 3/4 serving of steamed ShopRite brand baby carrots 61 calories. \\n\\nAfter dinner, I peel and dice up a Fuji Apple (63 calories), and combine it with 15 red seedless grapes (34 calories) a light and fit Greek yogurt (80 calories 12 grams of protein) and a serving of pumpkin spice Cheerios dry cereal for crunch (110 calories). \\n\\nFor dessert, I will have a pint of Bryers Delight chocolate ice cream (270 calories 21 grams of protein)\\n\\nLater after dinner, I will have a toasted Best Pita 80 calories with 16 grams of Smucker\\u2019s natural peanut butter (95 calories 4 grams of protein). \\n\\nThat\\u2019s a total of 1116 calories for a pretty substantial meal and leaves me with around 400 calories to play around with for the rest of the day (I still typically only eat dinner and my evening snack). \\n\\nI might use those calories to have oatmeal or eggs before work 100-143 calories or broil up an entire sliced and peeled eggplant for lunch (454 grams 115 calories) drizzled with wasabi sauce (15-30 calories). \\n\\nI hope this information can help others in their weight loss journey. \\n\\nTL; DR: Calories in, calories out, exercise, tracking.\\n\",\n",

I say that so you expect your loss to slow down to 1-2 lbs per week, instead of expecting 7 lbs per week. I see a lot of people get frustrated when it slows down, so I always try to make them aware so hopefully they've prepared to power through how slow it actually is. But in several months to a year, you'll find yourself at the weight you want to be at. A marathon, not a sprint! You've got this!\",\n",

The trick is not letting that be the routine. Chinese food twice a week is going to pack on pounds. Chinese food once a month isn't going to hurt you, and if you're doing things right, you're gonna be sick to your stomach if you eat as much as you could when you ate like that every day. I can really only tolerate half the portions of heavy foods that I used to eat all the time. And in order to keep it that way, the goal is to eat things that are good for you more often than eating things that aren't. Maintenance relies on sharpening your habits so that healthy food is the norm, and delicious fatty foods are a treat.\",\n",

For example, we all know that we should save money, so how many here have a well invested retirement plan?\\n\\nEducation isn't the problem with overeating in America.  It's primarily a cultural problem.  When you turn on the TV, you're hit with 3 food commercials during every break.  Every holiday has a major (heavy calorie) food component.  You've been conditioned, since birth, to eat three, square meals a day.  In my office, just like any other, food is attached to anything.  Being overweight isn't considered a vice, it's a condition.  We keep scooters at the door of the supermarket, if you can't carry your own weight, to get more food.  I could go on, but you get the picture.  We don't just enable obesity as a culture, we encourage it.\\n\\n*Update:  Don't let this come off as a fat people hate.  That wasn't my intention.  I just wanted to expand that the problem is so much larger than education, it's behaviors that have been programmed since birth by nearly every segment of American society.*\",\n",

Every child in every school go through 200 hours of it in the span of their first 10 years in school. It's both theoretical and practical. They learn about the food groups, nutrition, governmental dietary guidelines, food safety, sustainability and waste, budgeting, and the cultural aspect. In 7th and 10th grade, they have  designated classes every fortnight where they learn how to actually cook together in groups. They cook fish, meat, vegetarian food, breakfast, dinner, and so on. Sometimes they even bake cakes. The emphasis isn't on \\\"*everyone needs to eat this to be skinny*\\\". Instead, it's about teaching balance and helping the children make informed choices. \\n\\nEdit: I forgot, in grade 8-10, students can choose the elective \\\"Physical activity and health\\\", where they go deeper into the health aspect, and the actual science.

      "     \"body\": \"Okay can I just say something? Counting calories is important but people on this sub act like that\\u2019s all that there is to nutrition. That\\u2019s not true. I agree that nutrition should be taught in schools but it really is possible to be healthy/lose weight without counting calories. Yes, you basically end up doing CICO without realizing it which is fine. But the type of food you are eating is very important, and teaching kids that it doesn\\u2019t matter what they eat, only how much is a very dangerous method I think. And I see that attitude on this sub a lot. When people talk about counting calories not being a sustainable method of weight loss, that\\u2019s what they mean. This idea that the end all and be all is limiting your calories, if you do that and nothing else you will lose weight, don\\u2019t worry about getting enough protein and eating less sugar. That\\u2019s what\\u2019s not sustainable or healthy. yes you will lose weight. But odds are you cannot count your calories every day for the rest of your life, and if you\\u2019re eating very little portions of unhealthy food and not getting macros like protein fiber etc its not going to be a lasting lifestyle change unless you are changing what type of food you\\u2019re eating. Effective nutrition should be about eating fresh nutritious food .... calories are a component. Idk if I\\u2019m expressing myself right ....\\n\\nBut I really don\\u2019t feel like the problem is that people don\\u2019t know about calories. The problem is mostly that most people eat nothing but processed food which leaves you hungry and very susceptible to overeating and it\\u2019s seen as the normal thing to do. When I was living abroad in Europe in a country with a far far lower obesity rate it wasn\\u2019t that everyone counted calories all the time, it was that people made home cooked meals with vegetables and protein in them and didn\\u2019t eat processed lunches. Idk if this makes sense\",\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's important to talk about these feelings, and I want to help you find a way forward that feels more hopeful. Here’s an actionable plan based on the insights from others who have faced similar struggles.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Actionable Plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reach Out for Support**:\n",
      "   - **Talk to Someone**: Whether it's a friend, family member, or a mental health professional, sharing what you're feeling can help lighten the burden. You might be surprised by how many people genuinely care and want to help you through this.\n",
      "   - **Online Communities**: You’re not alone in this. Engage with online communities or forums where you can express your feelings. Sometimes, just knowing someone is listening can make a difference. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Identify the Pain Point**:\n",
      "   - Reflect on what is making you feel this way. Much like the analogy from the Arabic saying shared in one of the Reddit posts, sometimes we want to \"kill\" something inside of us rather than our whole selves. Identify what you want to change in your life. Is it a relationship, a job, or perhaps a feeling of isolation? Acknowledging the root cause can help you address it directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Take Small Steps**:\n",
      "   - **Set Daily Goals**: Instead of overwhelming yourself, break down your day into manageable tasks. This could be as simple as getting out of bed, going for a short walk, or engaging in a hobby. Celebrate small wins; they can build momentum.\n",
      "   - **Journaling**: Write about your feelings, your thoughts, or even what you’re grateful for. This can provide clarity and help you process what you’re going through.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Focus on Self-Care**:\n",
      "   - **Physical Activity**: Exercise has been shown to help alleviate symptoms of depression. Even a short walk can help. Remember the girl on the treadmill who felt vulnerable but still showed up? You can embrace your journey too, no matter where you start.\n",
      "   - **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Consider practicing mindfulness or meditation to help center your thoughts. This can help you gain a sense of control and peace amidst the chaos.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Professional Help**:\n",
      "   - **Therapy**: If you haven’t already, reaching out to a mental health professional can be incredibly beneficial. They can provide you with the tools and strategies to cope with your feelings more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Stay Connected**:\n",
      "   - Remember that there are people who care about you, even if it doesn't feel that way right now. Check in with friends or family regularly, even if it’s just a text. Connection can be a powerful antidote to feelings of isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Thoughts:\n",
      "As shared by others on Reddit, the pain you feel now doesn’t have to be permanent. It’s crucial to remember that while the thought of ending your life may seem like a solution, it only transfers the pain to those who care about you. You are worthy of support and love, and there is a way through this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please take care of yourself, and remember that it’s okay to ask for help.\n",
      "\n",
