The gave me the typcal full round routine with none of the typcal weight lifting. During the first month it had more effect and i felt that sactisfying muscle pain(?). The second month i wasnt feeling it any more so i started trying other things and increasing the weight. Im still unsatisfied so i started looking for tips online and found the ppl (pull push leg).  it looks good but it is different from what i was doing before and i don't really know how to use these thigs properly and am too afraid to ask someone if they can help me (they don't look so friendly there) and i also don't know anyone else that could help me.\\n\\nAnother thing is that i need to help my parents at work after school so i would need to give up some of my other activities to workout if i want to do the PPL routine.

I also have a fast metabolism which I know can be improved if I eat more. But recently I decided I want to gain weight and start working out to build up muscles so I can be healthy and look more well rounded. I\\u2019ve tried to get into working out multiple times I\\u2019ve even gone as far as spending 500 or so on  power rack and weights in hopes of building muscles and getting into the habit of working out. But I always give up after a couple of days of feeing motivated and after the motivation dies off I get back into the unhealthy habit of not eat and when I do eat a lot of it is unhealthy food like sugary snacks or 2 or 3 sodas a day.  The last few days I\\u2019ve woken up feeling like shit and every time I look into the mirror I look so skinny and scrawny with bad posture from all the time I spend sitting and playing games late at night. Whenever I go out to buy clothes nothing fits me because Im too small to fit into anything and every pair of jeans I have need a belt that is tightening to its limits because my waist is small as heck. I decided I no longer want these unhealthy habits of mine and want to look better feel better and be healthier.  Hopefully you guys have some tips or advice for me about working out/health / right type of food to eat but really any advice you guys give will be very much appreciated! Thank you!\",\n",
